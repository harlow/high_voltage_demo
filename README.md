# High Voltage Demo

This sample application allows visitors to view several static pages served by
the [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) gem.

It demonstrates several techniques:

1. A contact form for visitors to fill out.
2. Top-level routes to remove the `pages` directory from the path.
3. A 301 redirect to `/home` to the root path.
